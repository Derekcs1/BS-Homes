# BS-Homes
Buy and sell homes...Online!

Our project will consist of a website to simply buy and sell homes online. You must login to sell homes and may upload information about the house you wish to sell. On the house you are looking to buy there will probably be a forum to see comments about the house. Other small features will eventually be added.



April 9: Derek was absent today. Today Cameron and Robert made this github repository, the primary database of where our website will run off of. We also created and uploaded mock photos of what our website will look like--these photos can be found in the "mock photos" folder.
